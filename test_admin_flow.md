# Admin Authentication Flow Test

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Admin User Login
**Expected Behavior**: Admin users should bypass the approval screen and go directly to the main app

**Test Steps**:
1. Open the app
2. Login with admin credentials (role = 'admin')
3. Should see MainDrawerNavigator instead of AccountPendingScreen

**Implementation Check**:
- âœ… AuthScreen.js has admin role check: `userRole === USER_ROLES.ADMIN`
- âœ… Admin users bypass status check with direct navigation
- âœ… SafeAccess utilities used for error-safe object access

### 2. Regular User with Pending Status
**Expected Behavior**: Regular users with pending status should see the AccountPendingScreen

**Test Steps**:
1. Login with regular user credentials (role = 'member', status = 'pending')
2. Should see AccountPendingScreen with mobile-optimized UI

**Implementation Check**:
- âœ… Non-admin users with pending status directed to AccountPendingScreen
- âœ… Mobile-responsive UI with proper dimensions and spacing
- âœ… Status cards show appropriate messaging

### 3. Regular User with Approved Status
**Expected Behavior**: Regular users with approved status should access the main app

**Test Steps**:
1. Login with approved user credentials (role = 'member', status = 'approved')
2. Should see MainDrawerNavigator

**Implementation Check**:
- âœ… Approved users directed to main app
- âœ… Role-based navigation properly implemented

## UI Improvements Made

### AccountPendingScreen Mobile Optimization
- âœ… Responsive dimensions using `screenWidth` and `screenHeight`
- âœ… Proper typography scaling with `screenWidth * 0.XX` for font sizes
- âœ… Enhanced status card with gradient header background
- âœ… Improved spacing and padding using percentage-based values
- âœ… Card elevation and shadow for better visual hierarchy
- âœ… Better color scheme with branded colors

### App Icon Configuration
- âœ… Icon path properly set in app.json: "./assets/icon.png"
- âœ… Adaptive icon for Android configured
- âœ… Package name set to "com.karnavatiapp"
