# Issues Fixed & Solutions Summary

## ‚úÖ Problem 1: Missing or Insufficient Permission Error
**Status**: RESOLVED ‚úÖ

### What Was the Issue?
- When creating accounts, Firebase Firestore was blocking database writes
- Error: "missing or insufficient permission"

### Solution Applied:
**Updated Firestore Security Rules to allow development access:**

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow read/write access during development
    // WARNING: Do NOT use in production!
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

### Result:
- ‚úÖ Account creation now works successfully
- ‚úÖ User data is being stored correctly in Firestore
- ‚úÖ You can see the user record with all fields (buildingId: "F", countryCode: "+91", etc.)

## ‚úÖ Problem 2: Query Requires Index Error
**Status**: SOLUTION PROVIDED ‚úÖ

### What Is the Issue?
- Dashboard queries combining `where` and `orderBy` need composite indexes
- Error occurs when loading tickets or payments by user

### Solution:
**When you see the index error:**
1. **Click the link in the error message** - Firebase will create the index automatically
2. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for the index to build
3. **Try the query again** - it will work

### Required Indexes:
- **Tickets**: `userId` (Ascending) + `createdAt` (Descending)  
- **Payments**: `userId` (Ascending) + `createdAt` (Descending)

## ‚úÖ Problem 3: Firebase Storage Billing Issue

#### Files Modified:
1. **`src/screens/RaiseTicketScreen.js`**:
   - Commented out file attachment UI
